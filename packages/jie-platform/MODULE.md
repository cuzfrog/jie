## jie-platform
- agents do not directly know each other, they talk via events on an event bus.
- a CLI and a TUI
- provide an interface for `team-blueprint`, but agnostic of `jie-team` or any other team shape
- allow for configuring MCP servers; pluggable tool implementations; provide tool resolution
- storage interface for: context and memory management ; generic business agnostic artifacts
- agnostic of jie-team or code-lens
- depends on `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, API Reference in `jie-platform/pi-agent-api-reference.md`. We should follow pi conventions and reuse what it provides. Given a general question, check how does pi solve it.
