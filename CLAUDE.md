# Context Rules

- IMPORTANT: adhere to Code Conventions and Coding Principles

## Documents
- @doc/specs/monorepo-structure.md; read `00-overview.md` in the dir you will work with to understand the glossary.
- @doc/DEVELOPMENT.md
- @doc/plan/MILESTONES.md

### Document Authority
When rules in different documents conflict, context rules win, in below order. Raise to user for correction. Rules should not be in `doc/`.
1. `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — project-wide defaults.
2. `MODULE.md` (per module) — module-local API, visibility, and file layout.
3. `doc/addrs/NN-*.md` (ADRs) — source of truth for consequential decisions.
4. `doc/specs/<pkg>/*.md` (specs) — package-level blueprints.

## Document rules
- Keep your writing short and concise but accurate enough to avoid guessing room.
- Do not keep intermediate, transient history in md files under `specs/`, they are the up-to-date blueprint for the project.
- Do not record what you've done if the information is not helpful to make subsequent decisions.
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- Do not use newline to break sentences, no newline in the same paragraph. Let IDE wrap text.

## Conversation style
- Be concise, but must explain the reason and provide context information.
- When I ask a question, answer it before any actions.
- When I make a decision, reason it thoroughly, then express your opinion. Only when we both agree, we move on.
- Stick to fact. Our purpose is to build good software, don't fluff, challenge my ideas.
- Do not ask trivial questions where the answer is recoverable.

## Code Conventions
- No `any`, `unknown` types, no unsafe `as`, code must be strongly typed. No `enum` keyword.
- Prefer plain function over arrow functions.
- Fields default to be `readonly` in public types. On an interface, use methods instead of field arrow functions, methods are natively readonly.
- Public types, contract, methods, higher-level abstractions should be at the top of the files, private implementation details should be at the bottom. If a private function only is used in the same file, it should be below its callers. See below section `Single file layout`.
- Inline oneline trivial functions.
- Consolidate imports into one statement: do not split `import { a } from 'x'; import { type b } from 'x';` into two.
- Code identifiers (variables, parameters, class fields, function names) use camelCase. Names must be full words, no abbreviations beyond common ones (id, url, db, ts, cwd, pid, ctx, deps). Only serialized events/messages use snake_case. Module-level compile-time constants (e.g. `DEFAULT_COLS`, `MAX_RETRIES`) use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
- Keep code in one line if the line is < 140 chars. Do not break into multiple lines if the line is < 140 chars.
- Use `as const` for tuples and object-literals. Do not use `// @ts-expect-error` or `// @ts-ignore`, fix the type.

### Test
- use mocks for unit test. See @doc/HOW_TO_MOCK.md
- unit tests should align with the test target file. E.g. a test `function1.test.ts` should test and only test `function1.ts`. If `function1.test.ts` is testing `index.ts`, it is a smell of coding principle violation. Unit tests should not test dependencies.
- do not import `bun:test`, all test utilities have been added to global namespace and are compatible with `vi`.

### Single file layout (ordered from top to bottom)
1. imports (all imports must be at the top)
2. optional public domain/DTO types
3. one public interface (one primary public type)
4. one public factory function (createXXX)
5. private concrete implementation (class or OOP function)
6. private functions (at bottom, caller should be above callee)
7. optional `export as` visibleForTesting entries

### Git
- When involving git operations, refer to @doc/AGENTS_GIT.md.
- Do not use the `gh` CLI directly. Use `./scripts/gh-bot.mjs` so your identity is `abao-bot`.

### Coding Principles
- Read files in full before making wide-ranging changes, before editing files you have not already fully inspected, and when the user asks you to investigate or audit something. Do not rely only on search snippets for broad changes. Given a change, do not first attempt to insert into current code base. First look at it from a higher perspective, discover refactor opportunities.
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies; upgrade the dependency instead
- Naming must reflect the abstraction level. If a newly introduced function violates this, consider renaming the existing function to maintain correct abstraction levels, no matter how many files need to be changed.
- Avoid helper functions, helpers are bad, they are where code is coupled out of class hierarchy. helper functions are functions that are outside the abstraction hierarchy, containing domain logic, serving the only purpose of code reuse. ("utility/support" functions are not helpers, because they are purely technical without complex domain logic.)
- A function's parameters should be data it consumes, parameters should not be its dependencies. A higher-order function should only be used for pure transformation; orchestration with side effects should be a regular function. Context and config types are exempted from this rule.
- A responsibility should belong to an earlier performer. E.g. if type `Config` can parse the configuration into ready-to-use types, it shouldn't pass raw strings to its clients. A producer's return type is the one its consumer can use directly — no further parsing, validation, or normalization.
- Logic should be put in pure functions as much as possible. A function is pure when it has no I/O, no state, no dependency on external data, and no side effect on its arguments. Any side effect, e.g. IO, should be limited to the edge layers with minimal logic. This makes the code easier to test where a module's dependencies are mockable in tests so that unit tests can be done with mocks without creating actual dependency.
- A feature cannot ship by deferring an NFR(non-functional requirement); the NFR must be met in the same change. Do not be scared of change scopes, divide and conquer. Maintain good code architecture, follow context rules even if changes are big.
- No cyclical dependencies.

#### Module visibility
Minimal visibility or public surface of a type or a module. This ensures loose coupling and separation of concerns. If this is violated, e.g. a type or a module exposes multiple functions, it usually means the design is wrong. Do not add `export` unless it's proven neccessary.
- A *module* is a directory containing code. The `MODULE.md` lives at the module's root and gates its branching point in the tree.
- A single file should ideally have only 1 exported function and necessary types, all other things in the file should be file private. For unit testing complex logic, use `export as` at the file bottom with `_` prefix to the function, meaning only "visible for testing" (the underscore signals "internal seam", not part of the public API).
- - External imports must be from a module without specific file, e.g., `import { foo } from "../module"`. Not `"../module/index.ts"`. Refer to `Module gates` glossary. For siblings in the immediate directory, directly import from the sibling, e.g. `import { foo } from "./foo"`. For internal files, imports from specific files within the same module are allowed.
- In each module, search `MODULE.md`. You must follow its specifications. You cannot change the visibility. Any new exposure must be discussed with the user. If you are blocked, ask the user to review and manually add the exports. `sealed` files can still be edited, just no new exports.
- Cross boundary domain types, config types, global DTOs are exempted from the visibility rule.

#### SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: A function, class, or module should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Hide implementations behind interfaces. So that modifications happen without the client code needing to know.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Switching implementation should not violate the interface's contract, including implicit ones like side effects and error handling.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Abstractions should not depend on detailed implementations.

## Things to avoid
- do not `find` from the root dir, it's slow and unnecessary. Use `pwd` to figure out where you are.
- do not write test-only production code, testability should be achieved by adhering to above coding principles.
- do not add comments unless the code itself cannot tell, decisions should be captured in `doc/specs/` or `doc/addrs/`.
- do not skip tests, problems must be resolved.
- do not ignore tech debt you encountered, record them as Github issues so later other agents can analyze and fix.
- avoid worktrees.

## Best practices
- write down your plan before execution.
- when you have multiple steps in your execution, use a todo-list, divide and conquer.

(you can write tmp files to `./tmp/`, which is ephemeral)

## File Edit Checklist
Pre-action:
- Before adding utility functions/logic, check existing utils for reuse.
- Before adding logic to existing files, check if any coding principles are violated, if violated, propose refactoring first.
- Before any semantic or logic change, update or add tests to ensure coverage.

Post-action:
- After file edit (semantic or logic change), run tests.
